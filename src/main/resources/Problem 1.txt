Suppose you have a virtual simulation of an eco-system. 
You need to spawn different types of animals on this eco-system, by iterating a loop. 
The types of animals to spawn are Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Ducks, and Wolves. 

The eco-system is a single class with an ArrayList to hold all the animals living in that eco-system. 

By iterating a loop you can spawn all the animals. The loop goes from 1 to 100,
although configurable by the user. (Arbitary end values can be provided, so instead of 100,
maybe even 20 can be given)

On looping we can have conditions, saying something like this:
	If the iteration round is divisible by 5 then spawn a Dog 
	If the iteration round is divisible by 8 then spawn a Cat 
	If the iteration round is divisible by 10 then spawn a Wolf 

These conditions are supplied by the user, into the main loop and at each iteration you must check all conditions and spawn animals accordingly. 

Design a OOP system that implements this problem.
