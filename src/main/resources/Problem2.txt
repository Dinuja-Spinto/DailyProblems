Flight Booking problem:

Suppose you have a flight with 32 seats and you need to create a small system that allows people to book seats in that flight.

The user needs to know if a given seat is available or not in constant time O(1).
 -> boolean isSeatAvailable(int bookings, int seat);

The user also needs to book a seat if it's available with constant time O(1).
-> int bookSeat(int bookings, int seat);

You can think of the seats as an array of bits and via bit manipulation you can implement two functions for checking seat availability and
to book a given seat.

You cannot use a loop for checking seats or booking seats, since these operations must be done in constant time. O(1).
